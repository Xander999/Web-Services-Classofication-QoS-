For simplicity, QWS data is stored in a plain text file that contains multiple rows. Each row consists of information related to a particular Web service and includes the service name and Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) address. The Web services chosen from our repository were carefully selected to cover as many domains and service functionalities as possible. The information contained on the attached zip is believed to be accurate. Some of the services may have changed since our last crawl for creating this dataset.
